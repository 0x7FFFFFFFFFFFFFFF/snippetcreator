# SnippetCreator - VS Code Extension

## Words From The Author

**Terry Yang**

I created this extension to address my own needs for efficient code snippet creation and text manipulation. As both the developer and a daily user of this tool, I can personally guarantee its **safety** and **reliability**. Every feature has been thoroughly tested in my own workflow, ensuring that SnippetCreator delivers a seamless and secure editing experience.

## Overview

SnippetCreator started as a simple tool to create code snippets in separate files, but has evolved into a powerful text manipulation toolkit. While the name remains "SnippetCreator," it now offers a diverse set of features to enhance your editing workflow in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

### üìù Snippet Creation
Create well-formatted code snippets in separate files with ease:
- Quick creation of tabstops and multi-choice tabstops
- Automatic escaping of special characters
- Properly formatted JSON output for direct use in VS Code

### üîé Regex Selection
Quickly select multiple occurrences of text that match a regular expression pattern:
- Select all matches across your document in a single operation
- Edit multiple instances simultaneously

### üî¢ Number Sequence Generation
Replace multiple selections with auto-incremented number sequences:
- Support for custom starting values and increments
- Zero-padded number formatting (01, 02, 03...)

### ‚ûó Mathematical Operations on Numbers
Perform calculations on numeric portions of text:
- Apply simple operations (+, -, *, /) to numbers in selections
- Support for complex expressions with the selected number as a variable
- Decimal precision control for formatted output
- Works with both pure numbers and numbers embedded in text

### üìè Text Alignment
Align text based on specified characters or patterns:
- Align code by equals signs, colons, or any custom delimiter
- Support for regex-based alignment points
- Maintain proper indentation while aligning

### üåà Syntax Highlighting
Highlight different portions of text with vivid colors to improve readability:
- Multiple distinct highlight colors
- Persistent highlighting across editing sessions

### üîÑ Batch Text Operations
Store and replay multiple text replacement operations:
- Save sequences of find/replace operations for future use
- Export and import operation lists to share with team members
- Execute complex text transformations with a single command

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Access features through the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for frequently used operations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Feature | Windows/Linux |
|---------|--------------|
| Select by Regex | `Ctrl+Alt+S` |
| Text Alignment | `Ctrl+Alt+R` |
| Number Sequence | `Ctrl+Shift+N` |
| Math Operations | `Ctrl+Shift+M` |
| Add Highlight | `Ctrl+Alt+7` |
| Add a tabstop | `Ctrl+Shift+X` |
| Add a multi-choice tabstop | `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+X` |
| Save Current Snippet | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` |

Use the command palette for other features. In the command palette, type "SnippetCreator" to see all available commands.

## Known Issues
When clearing highlights, you may need switch to a different editor tab and back to see the changes. I have not yet found a way to force the editor to refresh the highlights.
