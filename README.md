I created this extension to address my own needs for efficient code snippet creation and text manipulation. As both the developer and a daily user of this tool, I can personally guarantee its **safety** and **reliability**. Every feature has been thoroughly tested in my own workflow, ensuring that *Terry's Snippet Creator* delivers a seamless and secure editing experience.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Access features through the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for frequently used operations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Feature | Windows/Linux |
|---------|--------------|
| Select by Regex | `Ctrl+Alt+S` |
| Text Alignment | `Ctrl+Alt+R` |
| Number Sequence | `Ctrl+Shift+N` |
| Math Operations | `Ctrl+Shift+M` |
| Add Highlight | `Ctrl+Alt+7` |
| Add a tabstop | `Ctrl+Shift+X` |
| Add a multi-choice tabstop | `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+X` |
| Save Current Snippet | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` |
| Line Operations | `Alt+L` |

Use the command palette for other features. In the command palette, type "SnippetCreator" to see all available commands.

## Known Issues
When clearing highlights, you may need switch to a different editor tab and back to see the changes. I have not yet found a way to force the editor to refresh the highlights.
